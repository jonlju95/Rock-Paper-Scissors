# Rock Paper Scissors
React app based on the game rock paper scissors. 

User chooses how many sets they want to play, then gets the three options. The computer then chooses one at random depending on if it won or not on that last round. The game ends if the amount of sets won reaches more than half of that set, i.e. best of number.

Made as part of my education.
